# data-analyst-task-5
In task 5 of data analyst internship, we do Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
EDA is the process of examining and understanding a dataset before applying any machine learning models or formal statistical methods.
It includes the visualizing representation of dataset like histograms(univaraint),barplots(bivariant).
I take one dataset named as titanic and I plot the histogram and barplots of data and print the additional information of the dataset.
